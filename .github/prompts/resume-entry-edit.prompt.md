# Goal
You are helping me revise a resume entry to sound more professional, impactful, and achievement-oriented. Use strong action verbs, focus on measurable results, and eliminate passive or vague language.

# Format
Rewrite the entry in a concise, bullet-point format appropriate for a modern tech resume. Each bullet should start with a strong action verb.

# Context
The resume is written in JSON Resume format. Each entry typically has a `position`, `company`, `startDate`, `endDate`, and `highlights`.

# Style Tips
- Use plain language, avoid buzzwords or clich√©s.
- If there are quantifiable results (e.g. "increased speed by 40%"), include them.
- Keep bullets under 20 words where possible.
- Avoid first person ("I", "we").
- Use agentic language vs communal language (e.g. "Developed" instead of "Was involved in developing").

# Example Input
```JSON
{
"position": "Automation Engineer",
"company": "Tesla",
"startDate": "2021-06",
"highlights": [
"Created a bunch of scripts to help manage servers",
"Worked with other teams to make tools easier to use"
]
}
```

# Example Output
- Developed PowerShell scripts to automate server configuration and reduce manual effort by 60%
- Collaborated across teams to streamline tooling, improving adoption and user experience

# Instruction
Rewrite the highlights section to be more polished and result-driven.
